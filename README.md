# moodmovie
a simple web-app, that searches for movies, which fit your current mood.
The Web-App will be able to recomend movies, from entering a series of emotion the movie you want to see should target. 
As a User you can rate movies and enter which emotions and genres the movie addresses. 

# Raking System 
Movies will be ranked by 0-100 from their quality and have a individual Fingerprint, that reflects the triggered emotions of other Users. 
First, Fingerprints of all Movies get compaired to find most uniquely fitting for your requests. This List will be sorted by the generell Rating. 
Furthermore you will be able to set extra rules, like the FSK or release date. But the goal of moodmovies is not to search for genre, but emotion. 

# Technical
Moodmovies uses the https://www.themoviedb.org/ Database and is so always uptodate. 
If you want to develop with it, you have to enter a API-KEY, which you can get through Themoviedb.
